# Sudoku-Solver
This sudoku solver will solve a sudoku grid using the backtracking algorithim assuming the grid can be solved.

This is a very simple sudoku solver. In order to use it the user simply clicks on a cell and inputs the number to be in the cell. The user may change
a cell that already has a number in it.

After the grid contains the sudoku the user may hit the 's' key on the keyboard and the it will return a solved grid.

Notes: When clicking on a cell if the user moves the mouse even if the mouse remains on the same cell it will remove the ability to input a number into
that cell until clicked again

If the grid is not solvable, when running the solver it will inform the user through the console output the grid could not be solved.

Things to add in the future: A better way to inform that the sudoku has been solved or not solvable. Add a way to display the actualy process of the backtracking
algorithim at work.
